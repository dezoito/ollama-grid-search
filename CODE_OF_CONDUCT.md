# **The Absolutely Crucial Code of Conduct**

Let's not be too pretentious here (like most of the other projects implementing the boilerplate version of this file):

1. Don't be an asshole and don't be annoying.

2. Follow the "contributing" guidelines in the README if you want to be a contributor.
